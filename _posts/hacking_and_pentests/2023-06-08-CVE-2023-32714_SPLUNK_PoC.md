This time I have analyzed the vulnerability of [CVE-2023-32714](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32714) Path Traversal in Splunk App for Lookup File Editing.<br>

The research was only to force my IT department to do they job and for me to learn much more.<br>

Security vulnerabilities are often abstract and if you can't see how easy some of them are to exploit, you can't raise awareness.<br>
It's actually hard to argue sometimes: Please do the update because there seem to be vulnerabilities.<br>
But it is very easy if you can say: Look this vulnerability is just as easy to exploit.<br>
That shortens many discussions extremely.<br>

Now I'm pissed off for Splunk Inc. and HackerOne

~~Jun. 2023 Here is my exploit.~~ Sep. 2024 Here **was** my exploit!

Ouch, where did the article disappear to?<br>
Apparently, by creating two reports via Hackerone, I agreed to Splunk's terms and conditions.<br>
They say.<br>
Yes, Splunk's landing page for reporting vulnerabilities refers to they GTC agreement.<br>
                                                                                     
`...vague redacted information deleted...`<br>
On 29. Jul. 2025 I received a message from HackerOne informing me that I am not permitted to disclose even vague information, not a single bit. Nothing, Nada, Zero.<br>
As if anyone could have done anything with this redacted information. Ok just deleted.<br>

What happens behind the stage? Splunk states to me
```
Splunk does not allow researchers to disclose contents of any submission without explicit Splunk authorization

Disclosure Policy
While we encourage you to discover and report to us any vulnerabilities found in a responsible manner, the following conduct is expressly prohibited and will result in possible legal action against you:
Disclosing any vulnerabilities or suspected vulnerabilities discovered to any other person or organization without explicit Splunk authorization;
Disclosing the contents of any submission without explicit Splunk authorization;
[....]
```

I agree to first sentence for my reports, as usual!<br>
Is this valid for research work on exploits for Splunk's advisory?

I have not found this chapter despite searching on their site or search engine.<br>
But ok, I follow the rules and I don't need any legal dispute.<br>

Lessons learned the hard way. Next time I will think twice to report to such VDP program.<br>
They don't need me, I don't need them.<br>
This is security research which is partly done for free for companies.

I will update this blog entry if I got the url pointing to this chapter.
