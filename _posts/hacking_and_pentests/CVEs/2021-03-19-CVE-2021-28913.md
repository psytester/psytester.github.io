The EIBPORT connects KNX or EnOcean building control with the IP world.<br>
[...]<br>
Whether simple or complex – use over 50 integrated services for almost all automation tasks in building automation. Program your own control sequences with the graphical LOGIKEDITOR or integrate third-party applications such as Amazon® Alexa.
[...]<br>
Via a secure connection, you can also control and maintain the EIBPORT remotely.
[...]<br>
On request, the EIBPORT also functions as an IP router in the KNX installation and as a programming interface to the ETS.<br>
